This is the code and data for EC1B1 Macroeconomics coursework. 
We aim to replicate a number of facts about exchange rates and output volatility, before and after various countries departed from the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. 
This replication is based on Itskokhi & Mukhin (2021). Itskokhi & Mukhin study the volatility of exchange rates and output for 8 countries. We will show that similar results hold for other countries.
